# Ahmed Elganagy
Red Team Trainee | Junior Penetration Tester

I am a cybersecurity practitioner focused on penetration testing, red teaming, and network and web security. I have developed a strong technical foundation through structured training programs such as the NTI Red Team Track, the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI), the Information Technology Institute (ITI) cybersecurity program, and the Commercial International Bank (CIB) cybersecurity internship.

My learning journey is driven by hands-on practice, continuous improvement, and building real offensive security skills. I am currently working on structured pentesting labs, network enumeration scripts, and web application vulnerability writeups to strengthen my technical capabilities and create practical, documented projects.
